## Quick start

**Small files** are stored directly in this repository under [`data/`](data/).
Clone or download individual directories as needed.

**Large files** (administrative boundaries, forests, coastal zones, etc.)
are distributed through [GitHub Releases](../../releases).
Each release tag corresponds to a data category.

```bash
# Download all state boundary files
gh release download admin/states --dir ./downloads/states

# Download only parquet files for districts
gh release download admin/districts --pattern "*.parquet" --dir ./downloads/districts

# Download everything for forests
gh release download environment/forests --dir ./downloads/forests

# List all available releases
gh release list
```

To download all release assets at once, use the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/download-releases.py
```
